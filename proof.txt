Algorithm:
Take all the geocoordinates along the border of the country and compare each point to another until we find the longest distance between the points. 
- Depending on criteria, distances that fall outside of the territory are deemed as faliures.

Note:
- Our data might be limited in that it does not consider all points along the the bordedr. It merely considers all points sufficient to create a polygon.
